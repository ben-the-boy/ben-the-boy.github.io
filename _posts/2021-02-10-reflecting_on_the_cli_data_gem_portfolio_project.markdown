The project process seemed a bit intimidating and overwhelming at first glance, with it being my first time starting on a completely blank canvas with little to no guidance as to what my code was supposed to fully embody. After watching several of the live builds that were supplied, however, things became a lot clearer and I was able to get in the necessary mindset for approaching this project. 

Setting up the Gem environment and ensuring all of its requirements were met was daunting enough, but after tackling that first step I was in a much more familiar place, and the logic and knowledge quickly kicked in as I began writing the actual meat of my code. Since beginning this course, it had been difficult for me to see the full applications of everything I had been learning, but this project ultimately showed me how to properly utilize the Ruby skills I've acquired and create a simple, but useful, tool. It was very reassuring once it all came together, and I can honestly say I came out feeling more confident in my abilities than before starting this project.
