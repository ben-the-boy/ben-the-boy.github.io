With it being the third portfolio project, and with the ease of launching a Rails project from scratch thanks to its magical methods, I was able to launch this project more smoothly than the previous two projects, and did not feel as intimidated by the blank canvas as I had in the past.  Deciding on an avenue that met the project requirements took some thought, and I always try to create something that has some real world merit despite this being a class project, because you never know where these early ideas could take you. Once I got my goals straight, setup was pretty simple thanks to the Rails generators, and I had my models and controllers stubbed out pretty quickly. After fine-tuning some elements, overall I feel very pleased with how my project turned out, and I enjoyed the challenges that I encountered along the way.
