Once again, as with the previous project, the most difficult and overwhelming task was starting from scratch on a blank canvas with no working enviroment already established, as is typically the case with the labs we complete. However, I found Avi's video to be quite helpful in getting this initial setup structured and implemented in order to create a familiar working environment that functioned exactly as intended. After completing this task, building out the MVC app itself seemed to flow much better than I anticipated, which definitely gave me reassurance and confidence in knowing that I was actually picking up on the patterns that are essential to proper app development through Sinatra. It was very clear to me that all of the labs building up to this project were coming together into one cohesive package, that required features from each of these prior labs to be pulled together to create a fully functional web app complete with multiple user accounts and security features to foster a safer experience. In the end, I feel very proud of what I accomplished with this project and overall I enjoyed the process very much.
